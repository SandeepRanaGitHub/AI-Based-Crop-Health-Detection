# AI- Based Crop Health Monitoring
<br>
This Project Demonstrate the use of Drone embedded with Thermal Camera, sensors in Agriculture as well as for Survillence, and how the Trained Model can be embed with Drone.
<br>
The Random-Forest Classifier Model trained on Multispectral data coming from various sensors and Camera gave good F-1 Score,Accuracy compare to other.
<br>
The intend for doing this project was to make the farming more efficient, adopt modern technology. This model can suggest the farmer to look at the disease crop area early which is not able for a human to see with naked eye.
